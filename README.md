# PyBot
PyBot is a bot for Discord, a voice and text communication application that is very popular among gamers.
I wrote this bot to help run a Discord server used by me and my friends.

PyBot is written in Python 3.7+ using [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) rewrite by [Rapptz](https://github.com/Rapptz).
